# BNO055 NDOF IMU
The BNO055 is an NDOF IMU made by bosch, incoperaiting accelerometer
gyroscope, and magnetometer readings to output linear acceleration.

## Calibration
The BNO055 needs to be calibrated everytime it enters the reset mode.
This calibration process is laid out by the data sheet. What is confusing
is that the data sheet implies that a previous calibration profile can be 
written directly to the proper registers, allowing for the process to be skipped,
maybe. I don't actually understand what it is that the data sheet is saying.
